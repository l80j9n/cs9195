He   asks   about   one of   the accounting frauds listed below – he’s heard the name but is only partly familiar with what   happened.   The assignment is to write a report which will explain the fraud in   detail   (i.e.   what   they   did,   why   they   did   it,   how they got away with it, when they were caught, consequences to the   company,   consequences to   individuals,   etc.).

Students also need to be aware that Microsoft’s Word as well   as grammar websites   such   as www.grammarly.comonly   catch   0 – 20% of   grammatical   mistakes. DO NOT RELY on   these   tools   as   a   final grammar check. Groups are encouraged to proofread other groups’ reports   on   an   exchange basis, to   catch English errors. 
Note also that various forms of   English are being taught around the world.   Students who were taught   English   in   a foreign country may not have learned North American English. ONLY North American   English   is   accepted by North American businesses.

Any form. of   plagiarism will result in a mark of   zero. Advice on how   to   avoid plagiarism   can be   found   at:
http://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/plagiarism 
Warning: Poor writing will result in an arbitrary reduction of   the assigned   grade,   to be   determined   at   the   sole
discretion of   the instructor. A very poorly written report will receive a grade of zero, regardless of content. Examples   of   poor   writing   that   will   cause   your   grade   to   be   reduced   include   any   of   the   following.
Evidence that the report has not been proofread at least twice prior to submission
Sentences   that   don’tmake   sense
Run on sentences   or paragraphs
Inconsistent writing style. from one section to the next   (the report must   appear   as though   one person   wrote it; therefore at least one group member must review the finished product   for   consistency)
More than 2 spelling   errors
Absence of   subtitles, bullets, tables or charts (i.e. it must look   like   a business report)
Ludicrous pagination (e.g. a sub-heading at the bottom of   a page)
Failure to include an executive   summary
A poorly written cover letter and/or opening paragraph (will most likely be   awarded zero   and   the remainder of   the report will probably not be read, i.e. exactly the same treatment   as one   can   expect   in   a   business environment) 
Failure to follow the guidelines provided to students for writing e-mails, memos,   letters   and business   reports (in   Learn)
